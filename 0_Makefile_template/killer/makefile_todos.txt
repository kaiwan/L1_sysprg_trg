VS Code -> GitHub Copilot (via the GPT-5 mini LLM):

Do you have any other 'best practice' suggestions for this Makefile, it's targets, add any more?

I'll add a concise todo plan of recommended Makefile improvements so we can track and implement them.

Created 10 todos

Progress: I added a tracked todo list with 10 suggested improvements.

Concise suggestions (pick any to implement):
- Add header dependency generation (-MMD/-MF + include *.d).
+  Build objects in a separate `OBJDIR` (out-of-source builds).
+ Declare `.PHONY` targets and make `all` the explicit default.
+ Add a `V=1` / `VERBOSE` toggle for quiet vs verbose builds.
- Add `install`/`uninstall` using `DESTDIR` and `prefix`.
- Add `distclean` and make `clean_lcov` fully wipe coverage metadata.
- Add tool presence checks with clear errors/warnings.
- Add `run`/`test` harness targets (use `CMDLINE_ARGS` and CI-friendly options).
- Add `fmt`/`lint` targets (clang-format, cppcheck, clang-tidy).
- Optionally add a clang/llvm-cov coverage path behind `USE_LLVM_COV=1`.

Which item(s) should I implement first?


Add:
separate out the logic below the 'User configurable section' into another common Makefile which can be 'included'?
